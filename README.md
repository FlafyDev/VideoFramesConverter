# VideoFramesConverter
Easily convert any video to a sequence of images by right-clicking a video file and selecting "Convert to Frames".
Every image represents a single frame from the video.

### Download
Press the green button `Code` and then `Download ZIP`.

### Setup
Extract the zip's content somewhere it won't get deleted and run the `install.bat`.

### Supported file extensions
By default this only works with the next file extensions:
`.mp4 .mkv .mov .wmv .avi .flv .mkv .webm`
If you want to add another one, open the `install.bat` file in a text editor and simply add another extension in line 7.
